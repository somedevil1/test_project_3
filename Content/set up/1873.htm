        <p>Before you put on your stuff and get moving, you must connect it to your mobile device or computer. Connecting your stuff (also known as pairing) makes sure it can transfer data back and forth with us (known as syncing). Your tracker data syncs to your dashboard, which is where you can see your stats, analyze historical trends, set goals, review your stuff, stuff, and more stuff. </p>
